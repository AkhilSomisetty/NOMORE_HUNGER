        <p>
            NOMORE HUNGER is an initiative aimed at reducing food waste and connecting event organizers with people in need.
            Through our platform, event organizers can share details of leftover food, and individuals looking for assistance
            can access this food, helping to minimize food wastage and provide nourishment to those in need.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our mission is to create a community where no food goes to waste and every leftover meal finds a new home. 
            Join us in making a difference, one meal at a time.
